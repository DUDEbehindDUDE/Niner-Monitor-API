# Niner Monitor API

This project provides the backend API for the Niner Monitor site, delivering real-time and historical occupancy data for various locations at UNC Charlotte. The API serves as a key part of the overall dashboard, enabling clients to fetch and display relevant information.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About the API

The API is currently hosted at [https://uncc-occupancy-tracker-backend.onrender.com](https://uncc-occupancy-tracker-backend.onrender.com). Please note that this URL is temporary and is likely to change in the near future to reflect the current project name. The API is built with ASP.NET and supports CORS to allow requests from other websites. However, depending on your usage, you might still need to configure CORS headers in your GET requests.
